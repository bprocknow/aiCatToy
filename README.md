# Ai Cat Toy

This is an automated cat toy.  
First there is a camera (Mac front camera).  Then there is AI that puts 
a bounding box on a cat (actually it usually thinks cats are dogs, sometimes horses).
Now mount a laser pointer to a couple motors, plug it into an Arduino and Boom!
The laser pointer will move away from the cat for endless fun.

## Usage
pip install torch, torchvision
pip install opencv-python
